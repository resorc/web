      <h2 class="myheader">Welcome</h2>
      
      <p> The EECS department of Syracuse University is proud to offer an
        undergraduate student research engagement program, <b>RESORC (Research Exposure in SOcially Relevant Computing).</b></p>
        
      <p>We encourage students from historically-underrepresented groups within computing and engineering to apply, which
        includes, but is not limited to, women, students of color, first-generation college students, and LGBTQ+
        students. Our goal is to expose students to what research career looks like,  to help them build self-efficacy, to train them develop 
        research and soft skills, and become stronger candidates for doctoral
        programs. The overarching goal of this program is to influence computing and engineering students career choices by providing a 
        supportive community of peers.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="myheader">About the program</h2>
      <p> Over the course of the RESORC program, students attend monthly research meetings, participate in technical, 
        research and soft skills building sessions, 
      work in teams to brainstorm about potential research topics,
      and connect with graduate mentors and faculties to be an active participant of their research lab. 
      Additionally, students in this program learn about socially relevant research problems in computing and engineering domain 
      and develop skills to propose and carry out independent research project over the summer or academic year with faculty mentor's supervision. </p>
      
      <p><b>Who can apply</b></p>
      All current undergraduate students at EECS department can participate in this program. 

     <p><b>Objective of RESORC</b></p>
      
    <li>To excite undergrad students through early exposure to “real computing and engineering” and the challenges facing CSE researchers today.</li>
    <li>To teach undergrad students the fundamental skills involved in conducting CS research.</li>
    <li>To expose undergrad students to paid research opportunities offered by the faculties of EECS department and nationally at other institutions.</li>
    <li>To foster an undergraduate research culture within the EECS department, with a particular focus on 
      1) sustaining a diverse and supportive community, 
      and 2) engaging students from groups currently underrepresented in CSE.

      <p><b>What experience needed?</b></p>
      It is better if the students have at least completed the introductory computer science
        course sequence. However, no prior research experience necessary!

      <h3 class="mysubheader">What will the program offer?</h3>
      RESORC will offer MENTORING, TRAINING, and COMMUNITY. In practice RESORC will achive this by offering monthly interactive workshop/meeting on --
      <li> undergraduate research skill building.</li>
      <li> improving technical skills in computing and engineering domain.</li>
      <li> soft skill development ().</li>
      <li> preparing application package for NSF REU sites.</li>
      <li> compiling materials for doctoral program admission.</li>
      <li> learning about domain specific research and professional development opportunities.</li>
      <li> networking with other undergraduate like minded peers, graduate students, faculties, and industry researchers .</li>
