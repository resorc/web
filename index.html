      <h2 class="myheader">Welcome</h2>
      <p> The EECS department of Syracuse University is proud to partner with <b>Google Research</b> to launch an
        undergraduate student research engagement program, <b>RESORC (Research Exposure in SOcially Relevant
          Computing).</b></p>
      <p>We encourage students from historically-underrepresented groups within computer science to apply, which
        includes, but is not limited to, women, students of color, first-generation college students, and LGBTQ+
        students. No prior research experience required! Our goal is to expose students to what socially relevant
        computing research can look like, to help them build self-efficacy and become stronger candidates for doctoral
        programs, and to influence their career choices by providing a supportive community of peers.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="about">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="myheader">About the Program</h2>
      <p><b>Who can apply:</b>All current undergraduate students at EECS department can apply. The program will be
        virtual. However, majority of our sessions will be interactive and synchronous, hence it may be useful to attend
        the sessions to achieve the maximum benefit.</p>

      <p><b>What experience needed:</b> It is better if the students have completed the introductory computer science
        course sequence. However, no prior research experience necessary!</p>

      <p><b>How much time commitment:</b> You will need to dedicate 2 days (Saturdays) in December and January to attend
        the virtual workshops.</p>
      <p><b>Any stipend:</b> Selected participants will receive a merit based stipend. Stipend recipients MUST be US
        citizen. </p>

      <h3 class="mysubheader">What will the program offer:</h3>

      <li><b>Workshop 1 (December 11, 2021):</b> A virtual workshop on exposure to many research areas of CS, Google
        Tensorflow workshop and higher education application process and best practices and a keynote by a Googler on
        state of the art computing innovation. </li>
      <li><b>Workshop 2 (January 22, 2022):</b> A virtual workshop on advanced Tensorflow topics, introduction to
        research methodologies, financing graduate education, preparing REU application, hearing from current graduate
        students and post-graduate career opportunities.</li>
      <li><b>Research opportunity:</b> Tons of research exposure to socially relevant computing based research problems
        from domain experts and disciplinary pioneers.</li>
      <li><b>Networking:</b> Meet and connect and network with faculty and industry researchers and graduate students
        who are amazing role models to learn from.</li>

          Federated learning (FL) is a distributed setting where clients collaboratively train a machine learning model, 
          without directly transferring or exchanging their private data. Originating from distributed training on mobile devices, 
          FL has been widely adopted in various applications. This presentation will cover the basics of FL, 
          as well as some recent advances of FL techniques at Google, with a focus on optimization and differential privacy. 
          The content will be primarily based on Advances and Open Problems in

          <b>Abstract: </b>
          The field of computer science could learn a lot from the sports industry, and vice versa. 
          Sports is inclusive, meaning if you are not able to play, you can participate as a fan or spectator, 
          and with the help of technology, through video games or online platforms. 
          Sports can be energizing, engaging, exciting and enjoyable, and so can computer science! 
          This talk will describe how Dr. Stukes’ undergraduate research lab leverages CS + Sports, 
          to provide a strategic pathway to teach applied data science concepts, 
          with an emphasis on culturally relevant data from individuals, devices, and systems.

          <b>Bio: </b>
          Dan Garcia (UC Berkeley MS 1995, PhD 2000) is a Teaching Professor in
          the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at UC
          Berkeley. Selected as an ACM Distinguished Educator in 2012 and ACM
          Distinguished Speaker in 2019, he has won all four of the department's
          computer science teaching awards, and holds the record for the highest
          teaching effectiveness ratings in the history of several of the
          department's courses. <br/>
          
          He is a national leader in the "CSforALL" movement, bringing engaging
          computer science to students normally underrepresented in the
          field. Locally, he serves as the CSforCA higher education
          co-chair. Thanks to four National Science Foundation grants, the
          "Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)" non-majors course he co-developed
          has been shared with over 1,000 high school teachers! He is delighted to
          regularly have more than 50% female enrollment in BJC, with a high
          mark of 63% in the Spring of 2018, shattering the record at UC
          Berkeley for an intro computing course, and is among the highest in
          the nation! He is humbled by the national exposure he and the course
          have received in the New York Times, PBS NewsHour, NPR's All Things
          Considered, USA Today, and the front pages of the San Jose Mercury

          <b>Talk Title: </b>"Great Ideas in Computer Science (aka The Beauty and Joy of Computing)"<br />
          <b>Abstract: </b>At a time when computing is so much a part of all of our lives, 
            has incredible job opportunities, and is so empowering, 
            most students graduate high school without having had any introduction to computer science. 
            A decade ago in the United States, the CSforALL movement was launched to broaden participation in 
            computing to those traditionally underrepresented. 
            This talk will reflect on the current state of that initiative, 
            and introduce the "Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)" course, which has received 
            worldwide attention and currently has 65% female enrollment at UC Berkeley, among the highest in the nation.<br />
